FORMED is an ncurses based object-oriented form editor.
Its forms display data in any way the user can think of and 
reads input from fields. The forms are resizable, but there
are guidelines for parameters to stay inside for optimum
results and inter-operability.

It displays formatted information and takes input from fields.

It is inspired by the noble FED (Forms EDitor) of yore.
